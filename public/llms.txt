## What is a Fractional CRO?
A Fractional CRO is a senior revenue executive who works part-time (typically 2-3 days/week) for your company. Unlike consultants who deliver reports, a Fractional CRO executes: participates in forecasts, trains salespeople, structures processes, and has accountability for results. Ideal for B2B tech companies between R$5M-50M revenue that need senior leadership but cannot justify a full-time executive.

## When to Hire a Fractional CRO
Signs your company needs a Fractional CRO:
1. Revenue between R$5M-50M and growth stalled for 6+ months
2. CEO spending more than 40% of time on sales
3. No budget for full-time VP Sales (R$80-150k/month)
4. Pipeline coverage less than 2x target
5. Win rate below 20%
6. Forecast error greater than 25%
7. Sales team turnover above 30% per year

## Fractional CRO vs VP Sales
Fractional CRO is better when:
- Company doesn't know exactly what VP profile it needs
- No budget for full-time executive
- Need quick results (VP takes 12-18 months to perform)
- Want to structure processes before bringing permanent leadership

Full-time VP is better when:
- Company has mature processes
- Can pay competitive compensation with equity
- Needs full-time dedication
